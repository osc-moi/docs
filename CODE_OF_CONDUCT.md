# Open Source Club - Moi University's Code of Conduct

## Introduction

This code of conduct applies to all members of this community and all new members are required to have read it.

## Core Values

_Commitment_ 

We are required to try our best to commit to the course of the community by fully taking part in our activities.

_Team Work_

Being the open source community we are required to collaborate and not compete with each other. This way we are more productive.

_Respect_

We are required to respect everyone who is a part of this community and all other persons invited to be a part of this community during our activities. Property belong to other people such as laptops, phones and bags must be respected.

_Honesty and Integrity_

We expect this to be observed in all dimensions. In dealing with others, performing tasks and handling responsibilities.

## Decision Making

We are a community and thus any decision made affects the whole community. Let it be made clear that decisions made by anyone in the community will only be applicable if approved by the executive board of the community. It will be against our code of conduct for a decision affecting the whole community to be made and implemented without consulting the leadership body.

## Anti-harassment Policy

Harassment includes and is not limited to offensive or verbal written commments related to gender, age, 
sexual orientation, disability,physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, 
veteran status, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, 
sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome physical attention. 
If what you are doing makes someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harrassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.

Club members asked to stop harrasing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Club members, the patron, the clubs officials; the chairperson, the treasurer, the secretary and the team leaders 
are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. There should be no use of sexualised images, activities, or other 
material during club activities and events. There should be no use of sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or 
otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If anyone subject to the club's Code of Conduct engages in harassing behaviour, OSC - Moi University may take any 
action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the club and its future activities and events.
