# Open Source Club - Moi University's Code of Conduct

## Introduction

This code of conduct applies to all members of this community including sponsors and those with decision-making authority. Everyone subject to this Code of Conduct is required to have read it.

## Core Values

_Commitment_ 

We are required to try our best to commit to the course of the community by fully taking part in our activities.

_Team Work_

Being the open source community we are required to collaborate and not compete with each other. This way we are more productive.

_Respect_

We are required to respect everyone who is a part of this community and all other persons invited to be a part of this community during our activities. Property belong to other people such as laptops, phones and bags must be respected.

_Honesty and Integrity_

We expect this to be observed in all dimensions. In dealing with others, performing tasks and handling responsibilities.

## Decision Making

We are a community and thus any decision made affects the whole community. Let it be made clear that decisions made by anyone in the community will only be applicable if approved by the executive board of the community. It will be against our code of conduct for a decision affecting the whole community to be made and implemented without consulting the leadership body.

## Expected Behaviour

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

   - Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
   - Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
   - Attempt collaboration before conflict.
   - Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
   - Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
   - Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## Unacceptable Behaviour

OSC - Moi University shuns all forms of physical, verbal or visual harrassment and bullying. Harassment and bullying includes and is not limited to:

   - Offensive or verbal written commments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status or veteran status.
   - Displaying or posting sexual images.
   - Deliberate intimidation.
   - Stalking or following other people.
   - Harassing photography or recording.
   - Sustained disruption of talks or other events.
   - Inappropriate physical contact or unwelcome physical attention.

If what you are doing makes someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harrassment and is enough reason to stop doing it. Club members asked to stop harrasing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Club members, the patron, the clubs officials; the chairperson, the treasurer, the secretary and the team leaders 
are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. There should be no use of sexualised images, activities, or other 
material during club activities and events. There should be no use of sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or 
otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact 
OSC - Moi University using the procedures defined below.
